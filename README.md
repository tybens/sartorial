## Things to keep in mind

- How to export cloud firestore data: https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/manage-data/export-import#google-cloud-console

## Todo:

- I stopped using this todo list after a while. Lots was done
- ~~Email list to collections page (for the time being)~~
- ~~Collections~~
- ~~Add metadata to paymentIntent (so we can observe what payment is for which besides the intent_id)~~
- ~~"Order ref: {}", consider telling the user about their order's unique id so they can feel valued~~
- Stylistic changes
  - ~~Change button color scheme to be more universal and less generic. Probably to a slick black & white~~
  - ~~fade transitions (cp andstudio.lt)~~
  - ~~Cart view is gross~~
  - ~~Hover to show image preview~~
  - ~~Darkmode to Sponsors page~~
- ~~Email domains~~
- ~~Add state code to checkout form~~
- ~~Fix appbar (make cart show below shop)~~
- ~~Dl andstudio.lt video intro and use to test video intros~~
