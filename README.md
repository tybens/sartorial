## Todo:

- Add state code to checkout form
- Add metadata to paymentIntent (so we can observe what payment is for which besides the intent_id)
- "Order ref: {}", consider telling the user about their order's unique id so they can feel valued
- Automate cloud functions url between dev and prod
- Dl andstudio.lt video intro and use to test video intros
- Stylistic changes
  - fade transitions (cp andstudio.lt)
  - Cart view is gross, as are most other views
  - Change button color scheme to be more universal and less generic. Probably to a slick black & white
